# LangChain
## What is LangChain?

- LangChain is an open-source framework that helps you build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

- It provides ready-made components like prompts, chains, memory, retrievers, and agents so you can connect LLMs with your own data, tools, and workflows.

## Why do we need LangChain?

- We need LangChain because LLMs alone are not enough.

- LLMs are powerful, but they cannot:

    - remember long conversations

    - connect to databases

    - search documents

    - call APIs

    - follow multi-step workflows

- LangChain solves all these problems.

## Short Answer
- LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered apps.
- We need it because it helps connect LLMs with external data, memory, tools, and multi-step workflows, making AI applications more practical and powerful.”
